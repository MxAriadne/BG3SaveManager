## Description
Hi! So I noticed that the two save managers for Baldurs Gate 3 don't seem to work particularly well for one reason or another. I just made my own because I really wanted to have an automated process before I went ahead with modding the game lol.
This program lists all saves and allows you to back them all up at once, backup specific saves, and import the save backups back into the game saves.

## Usage
* Requires minimum JRE 17.
* I advise you contain the executable in a folder and make a shortcut if you plan to use it regularly, this is because the save files are archived to a local directory in the same root as the execuable.
